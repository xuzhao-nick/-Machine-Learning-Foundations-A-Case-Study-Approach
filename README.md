This course is an open course from <a href="www.coursera.org">www.coursera.org</a>, it including the first step in becoming a machine learning expert. From this course one can learn a broad range of machine learning methods for deriving intelligence from data, and by the end of the course you will be able to implement actual intelligent applications. 


##Programming assignments

###<a href="Predicting house prices.md">Predicting house prices</a>
<img src="data/images/output_16_1.png">

In this assignment, we build a regression model for predicting house prices by including some features of the house. 


###<a href="Analyzing product sentiment.md">Analyzing product sentiment</a>
<img src="data/images/evaluate_model_1.png">

In this assignment, we focused on classifiers, applying them to analyzing product sentiment, and understanding the types of errors a classifier makes.

###Retrieving Wikipedia articles

In this assignment, we focused on using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, by analyzing their text. We explored two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF. 


##Recommending songs

In this assignment, we focused on building recommender systems to find products, music and movies that interest users. 

###Deep features for image retrieval

In this assignment, we focused on using deep learning to create non-linear features to improve the performance of machine learning.
